Bronze is the only manufacturer of WoodStock sheets in Iran.
The main extruding product at Bronze Plast Salon is polywood Sheets, These sheets, which make up the bulk of our products are among the most commonly used materials in the world of door panel and parcel shelves. The above mentioned sheets were imported from outside the country, By launching an extruding machine and producing these sheets in the bronze company, In order to self-sufficiency and to prevent the withdrawal of currency from the company, a significant step was taken.In most products of the company, wood composite sheets are used to produce the final products.

The bronze laboratory began its operation at an area of ​​about 40 square meters, with the launch of the Bronze Company, with only one device to test the impact of the free fall of plastic parts. At the same time as the development of bronze company, a number of test methods and devices of this laboratory were added and devices such as Tensile, HDT / VICAT, Oven, Chambers, environmental conditions and … were added to the laboratory equipment.

In 1993, by changing the bronze qualitative approach and adding more key components to the bronze production complex, the lab building was moved to a larger location and after updating and equipping it with world-day devices such as the Airborne Static Deployment Test (SDT), a test similar to The sunshine (SUN SIMULATOR) and spectrophotometer (SPECTROPHOTOMETR) have grown to around 400 square meters.

The lab now has more than 25 key devices in the testing of materials, polymer parts and automotive products, such as durable treaders for all types of vehicle assemblies such as DOOR SLAM, durability of the dashboard and durability of the door handle, and … One of the largest and most qualitative references for the testing of polymer products, and in particular automobile decoration, offers its services to all partners and non-automotive car companies.

Due to the production of polywood and geomembrane sheets in the production lines of this complex, the bronze laboratory has been equipped with the equipment and testing methods for these products and is now able to carry out the process of servicing this product line and satisfying its customers . All mechanical tests are on these products.

The bronze laboratory has a test confirmation from all automotive companies working with them, such as Iran Khodro, Saipa, Renault Pars and Kerman Khodro. In order to continuously improve the services provided to customers, the laboratory acquired ISO-17025 certificate from the National Center for National Certification in 1996 and became a reference laboratory in the field of quality control services for polymer products. This laboratory is prepared to offer its services to a wide range of industries in the field of related or non-related work, and is not expected to attend any kind of visit or co-operation meetings.

# IS Views
In general, in a product warehousing system, the process is to send the goods to the warehouse after production. The sales unit according to the consumer inventory in the warehouse sells the goods to the customer.
Initially, the warehouse keeper will list the new goods for the first time and enter details into the warehouse system with the name and specifications which are not previously stored in the warehouse.
Also, the warehouse keeper enters the new warehouse details which are being used for storing the product, according to its specifications. The warehouse keeper logs it into the system after receiving the goods from and issuing the receipt. From now, this product is counted as a warehouse stock and the name and specification of the product are in the system.
Then, given the inventories available for this product, the inventory can be obtained by the system and provided to the sales department. Customer contacts to Factory Sales Unit for Purchasing. After the customer is registered in the system based on the merchandise inventory, the order is registered and a date is set for contracting and finalizing the order, which can be the same time (at the time of the agreement). Costs are incurred and the order cannot be changed after the contract has been concluded.
The sales unit sends a custom remittance to the warehouse keeper.The warehouse keeper communicates with the customer after checking the items and coordinates the exact specifications of the time and place of delivery with the customer. The warehouse keeper issues the loading permit for the remittance and delivers it to the driver along with the delivery address. Once the goods are delivered to the customer, they will receive a receipt from the customer.In the event of any defects in the goods and their referral by the customer, returning invoice is issued for the customer and refund the cost of the reference item. Then the sales unit after receiving the item from the customer will send it to the production line for correction.On the other hand, during the selling process, there is always a need for contacts between the warehouse keeper and the sales unit to ensure whether goods are available or not.
