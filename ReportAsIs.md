# Business Model Canvas

## Functional view, processes

List and describe key processes

| Process name | Description (text) | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   |   |   |   |

(must be consistent with key processes box in BMC)

| Application name | Vendor (or internal if made internally) | Main functions |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |   |   |

### Technological view

(applications are the ones identified in application portfolio)

Highlight which IT service is outsourced (if any)

# IT strategy

Summarize the current IT strategy, discuss if it is consistent with the company strategy

|   |   |   |   |   |   |

### Process Y

To be repeated for each relevant process (notably processes that will be changed in To Be)

# Summary analysis

Critical points in the organization and their possible interaction with IS.

IT alignment problems.
